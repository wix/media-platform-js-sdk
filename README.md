## Develop
If you want to help make Media Platform JS SDK better - **you are awesome** and you are welcome!
Please read the information below, it is very important to generate proper CHANGELOG and proper versioning.

#### We are using [standard-version](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/standard-version) - the tool with automate versioning and CHANGELOG generation, with semver and conventional commit messages.

So, you should name your commits via [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/).

#### Examples:
##### Why is `chore`, `style`, `refactor`, `docs`, `ci` or `build` entries not in my CHANGELOG?

These entries shouldn't make any difference to your end-users, unless there's a BREAKING CHANGE, in which case the entry **will** be included in the CHANGELOG. [Reference](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/standard-version/pull/195)
So in the [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) file you can see only commits with types `fix`, `feat` and text `BREAKING CHANGE`.

##### How to use type `fix`:
Commit with `fix` type will change the *patch* version: 1.0.**0** -> 1.0.**1**
```
fix: minor typos in code
```

##### How to use type `feat`:
Commit with `feat` type will change the *minor* version: 1.**0**.0 -> 1.**1**.0
```git
feat: allow provided config object to extend other configs
```

##### How to use `BREAKING CHANGE`:
A *BREAKING CHANGE* text can be part of commits of any(fix, feat, etc.) type and will change the *major* version: **1**.0.0 -> **2**.0.0
You should use `BREAKING CHANGE` with another type. [Specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.3/#specification)
```
fix: change photo service color results
BREAKING CHANGE: getPhotoColor returns array instead of object
```
